# :sparkles: Spark RSS

Application to allow article & news reading an RSS feed on a Kindle (8th gen)
Functionality is based on feature in Calibre: but want to give it a go myself.

## Features
### Minimum Features:
* Track multiple RSS feeds (news aggregater sites + blogs)
* Pull down articles & news aggregater comment threads
* Render the content into a PDF/MOBI sized and formatted for the device
* Email the rendered document to the kindle device

### Tasks:
* Proof of concept the entire chain to confirm the file formats & idea works
* Parse hacker news rss feed for the article & comment thread info.
* Proof of concept rendering of articles as images in some kind of web page viewer to see if that's viable. Will decrease dev resources massively if render can be one-size-fits-all.
* Proof of concept comment thread renderer specifically designed for hacker news.
* Create simple epub / mobi output file.
* Send an email with some file.
